# BOII | Development - Utility Library **W.I.P**

Welcome to boii_utils, a comprehensive utility resource tailored for game developers and server administrators. 
Our suite of tools is designed to simplify, streamline, and enhance the development process, offering a wide range of functionalities that span from string manipulations to table operations, and from input validations to miscellaneous utilities.
This resource is still a work in progress and probably will be for quite some time.

The aim here is just to create a large consolidated resource to handle the majority of repeat code and cut down on repetitive typing in the long run. 

A lot of the current functions have been tested and are working, however a large portion still has not been tested. 
Any issues with any part of this resource please let us know through an issue or within discord and we can get those changes made asap.

2. Drag and drop `boii_utils` into your server resource and ensure this before any scripts using the resource.
3. Restart server or restart script live either or works.
